Rock Paper Scissors is a simple hand game where two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules are straightforward: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same, it's a tie. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Hand Gestures:
Rock: A closed fist. 
Paper: A flat hand with fingers and thumb extended. 
Scissors: A fist with the index and middle fingers extended. 
2. The Rules:
Rock beats Scissors: Because rock can smash or break scissors. 
Scissors beats Paper: Because scissors can cut paper. 
Paper beats Rock: Because paper can cover rock. 
3. Playing the Game:
Both players simultaneously display one of the three hand gestures. 
If both players choose the same, the round is a tie, and they repeat. 
The player with the winning gesture wins the round. 
A common method is to count down "rock, paper, scissors, shoot!" and make the gesture on "shoot". 
4. Strategy:
The game is a zero-sum game, meaning one player's win is another's loss. 
There's no perfect strategy; the best approach is often to choose randomly. 
However, understanding how opponents might react based on their previous choices can provide a slight advantage.
